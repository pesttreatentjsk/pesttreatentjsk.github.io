The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine examinations. Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and diseases, though contested by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the increase of pest control.</p>
