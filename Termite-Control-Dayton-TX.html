While pheromones are absolutely nothing new to pest control-- pest control professionals often utilize pheromones traps as a way to monitor pest populations-- including them to insecticides is a new concept. </p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack away from the crop. Controlling pests can be carried out in lots of ways but a reliable method is to clear out the bugs frequently. In this guide we define standard or chemical insecticides as those having a broad spectrum of activity and being more damaging to natural opponents.</p>
