<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household pest pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide use.

<p>It is an ecosystem approach to crop production and defense that combines various management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimise making use of pesticides. IPM coordinates using pest biology, environmental details, and offered technology to prevent undesirable levels of pest damage by the most cost-effective methods, while minimizing risk to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>Throughout the argument on alternative approaches for controlling pests, various ideas have been expressed and brand-new techniques have actually emerged.

Use proper crop rotation practices and target pests with multiple modes of action to make it more difficult for pests to adapt. </p>
