The historic and more prevalent use of this term is limited to use of natural enemies to manage populations of pest organisms. Some scientists likewise acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might take place, even yearly management of a continuous pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).</p>
<p>In West Africa, the use of okra as a trap crop reveals gratifying lead to fighting bollworms and other cotton pests. There was a great deal of termite concern I was dealing with previously and with this service I was able to control termite to a great extend. Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C.

Three disciplines, Biological Control, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and Biotechnology, have actually attained particular importance in our mission for better pest control methods.</p>

Pests assault plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae ruin leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air. </p>
<p>Using details about pests' biology and routines, along with a toolbox of pest management techniques, pest control employees find, determine, and get rid of pests. However since these "sex" traps bring in primarily male insects, they aren't extremely efficient controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest.
