<p>Biological pest control procedures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed.

Some termite control professionals even repair structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the safest for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds rather of a whole area. Due to any variety of factors, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the effectiveness of natural enemies often enables prospective pest organisms to experience practically unregulated population development and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
