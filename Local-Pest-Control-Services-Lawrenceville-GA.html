The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, vermins, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow coats, bees and flies are typically discovered pests in our society.</p>
