<p>It is an ecosystem approach to crop production and defense that combines various management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimise making use of pesticides. IPM coordinates using pest biology, environmental details, and offered technology to prevent undesirable levels of pest damage by the most cost-effective methods, while minimizing risk to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
