There are four significant parts in the new IPM design that resolve different pest management options, the understanding, and resources the grower needs to deal with the pest concern, planning and organization of information to take appropriate management actions, and preserving great communication to share and acquire knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very crucial step owing to the fact that a variety of pests are providers of hazardous disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the removal of a couple of pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
